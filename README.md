Motor Control for ModBot V2
This code is primarily for demoing the Motor Control capabilities of the Edison for Intel's visit to the lab on 10/27/2015 utilizing an 
Intel Edison controlling a ESCON 36/3 motor controller and a Maxon motor.

This code will be modified later to implement the full motor controller code for ModBot V2.

Written in C.
